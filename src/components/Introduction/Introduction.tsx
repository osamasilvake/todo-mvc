      Developers have a number of choices today when it comes to selecting a
       JavaScript framework or UI library for building scalable web apps.
      </p>
      <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] leading-[1.5] pb-3">React / Next.js, Vue / Nuxt, 
        Angularâ€¦the list of solutions continues to grow, but just how do you 
        decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?</p>
        <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] leading-[1.5] pb-3">To help you understand the options, we created TodoMVC - a project 
            which has offered the same Todo applications implemented in popular 
            JavaScript frameworks for the last decade.</p>
            <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] leading-[1.5]">
            TodoMVC is useful for comparing syntax and solutions, 
            is officially used in cross-browser benchmarks (e.g. Speedometer) 
            and aims to stay up to date as trends change over time.
